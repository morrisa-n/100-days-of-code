# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: Saturday, June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start doing this

**Thoughts:** Officially starting it tomorrow, because I like things to be nice and even like that. Since I'm almost-but-not-quite a complete beginner, and not really proficient enough for my own projects yet, I'm just planning to work through the many Python books I have sitting around at first, and maybe a few other little bits and pieces of things. Once I've found my footing a little better, I'll start doing other things.

**Link to work:** Forked the [100 Days of Code repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) over [here](https://github.com/morrisa-n/100-days-of-code).
