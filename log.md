# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Saturday, June 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Decided to start doing this. Did first two lessons in Codecademy's [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial&mdash;Site Structure and A Closer Look at CSS.

**Thoughts:** ~~Officially starting it tomorrow, because I like things to be nice and even like that.~~ <- Nevermind that. Ended up spending an hour doing a Codecademy tutorial, so I'm counting it as day one.

Since I'm almost-but-not-quite a complete beginner, and not really proficient enough for my own projects yet, I'm just planning to work through the many Python books I have sitting around at first, a few HTML/CSS tutorials, and maybe a few other little bits and pieces of things. Once I've found my footing a little better, I'll start doing other things.

**Link to work:** Forked the [100 Days of Code repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) over [here](https://github.com/morrisa-n/100-days-of-code). Finished the first two parts of Codecademy's [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial in an hour (11pm-12am).

## Day 2: Sunday, June 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished the [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial in ~40 minutes. Finished the Loops chapter of the book The Self-Taught Programmer. Installed Apache server on my (Windows 7) computer, but have NO IDEA what to do with it yet.

**Thoughts**: The only really new-to-me stuff in the Make a Website tutorial was the Bootstrap stuff, and that's just fancy CSS. Not very thorough, but I wasn't expecting it to be. Their [Learn HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css) tutorial is on my to-do list, but not today. Next on today's agenda is more Python.

...okay, more Python done. I still can't quite wrap my brain around iteration and loops. I think I need devote a LOT of attention to loops in the near future.
