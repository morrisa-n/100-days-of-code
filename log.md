# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: Saturday, June 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Decided to start doing this. Did first two lessons in Codecademy's [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial&mdash;Site Structure and A Closer Look at CSS.

**Thoughts:** ~~Officially starting it tomorrow, because I like things to be nice and even like that.~~ <- Nevermind that. Ended up spending an hour doing a Codecademy tutorial, so I'm counting it as day one.

Since I'm almost-but-not-quite a complete beginner, and not really proficient enough for my own projects yet, I'm just planning to work through the many Python books I have sitting around at first, a few HTML/CSS tutorials, and maybe a few other little bits and pieces of things. Once I've found my footing a little better, I'll start doing other things.

**Link to work:** Forked the [100 Days of Code repository](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) over [here](https://github.com/morrisa-n/100-days-of-code). Finished the first two parts of Codecademy's [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial in an hour (11pm-12am).

## Day 2: Sunday, June 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished the [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website) tutorial in ~40 minutes. Finished the Loops chapter of the book The Self-Taught Programmer. Installed Apache server on my (Windows 7) computer, but have NO IDEA what to do with it yet. Did more Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: The only really new-to-me stuff in the Make a Website tutorial was the Bootstrap stuff, and that's just fancy CSS. Not very thorough, but I wasn't expecting it to be. ~~Their [Learn HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css) tutorial is on my to-do list, but not today.~~ Next on today's agenda is more Python.

...okay, more Python done. I still can't quite wrap my brain around iteration and loops. I think I need devote a LOT of attention to loops in the near future.

And scratch that about not working on the Learn HTML & CSS tutorial. I did some more of that this evening.

**Link(s) to work**: [The Self-Taught Programmer, Chapter 7: Loops - My Answers](https://github.com/morrisa-n/100-days-of-code/blob/master/tutorial-answers/STP-loops.py)

**Goals for Tomorrow**:
* Get through another chapter of The Self-Taught Programmer
* Get through more of the Learn HTML & CSS tutorial

## Day 3: Monday, June 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Got started on the [Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) project on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). Probably spent well over an hour on it alone. It's still rough, but I've made significant progress. ~~Next up: Python.~~

Later: Declared the Tribute Page done enough to submit on FCC. Ended up getting sucked into the Responsive Web Design course on the FreeCodeCamp Beta. Didn't get to Python.

**Thoughts**: I chose to honor my late dog for the Tribute Page challenge, because he deserves it. He is very sorely missed.

I let myself get sucked into HTML and CSS stuff today. And have started considering whether I want to stick to Python or switch to JavaScript, since I seem more drawn to the front-end of things. I like playing with HTML and CSS, and JS makes them tick, soooo...

**Link(s) to work**:
* [Tribute Page Code](https://github.com/morrisa-n/freecodecamp/tree/master/Project-Drafts/Tribute)
* [Tribute Page](https://writercracksthecode.neocities.org/Tribute/index.html)

**Goals for Tomorrow**:
* More FCC beta
* More Python?

## Day 4: Tuesday, June 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day poking at the FCC Portfolio challenge. Haven't upload what I have so far yet. Pretty sure I spent way over an hour on it, though.

**Thoughts**: I really like working with HTML and CSS. Integrating Bootstrap&mdash;especially in ways that keep it looking different from all of the cookie-cutter Bootstrap sites out there is definitely a challenge.

**Link(s) to Work**: None yet

**Goals for Tomorrow**:
* Having some major dental work done tomorrow, so my only goal is to get an hour of *something* done.
